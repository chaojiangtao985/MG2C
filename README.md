One is gene location (input1), and the other is chromosome length (input2). The former contains 5 fields: gene_ID, gene_start, gene_end, chr_ID and gene_color. Gene_color is an optional field used to customize color of the gene ID, with the default in black. The latter contains two fields: chr_ID and chr_length.The delimiter between the fields is "TAB". Users copy and paste the input data into the corresponding textbox, left-click the "DRAW"button, and a genetic map will be generated by MG2C.
